    <h1>It appears that you have gotten lost, or your internet is down</h1>
    <p>If you think your internet is down, then click the link below to be
      taken to what should be an offline version of the site, though in 
      reality its just because I couldn't figure out how to get github to 
      redirect from https://pavansproject.github.io to 
      https://pavansproject.github.io/index.html. Its a weird situation,
      but anyway, click it.</p>
    <h3>But do note: This will only work if you have been to the site before as it does cache the site</h3>
